Exploring the city one evening, you enter an apparent nightspot intriguingly
named Club Zombie. You're immediately grabbed, armed with a club, and dropped
into an arena where you're pitted in combat against zombies for the amusement
of the bloodthirsty patrons.

You need to hit a zombie twice to really kill it. 
Once you get a hit from the zombie, you lose your life. 

Enter u/d/l/r to move to the corresponding directions, or attack the zombie
in that direction.

Enter h to review your killing history, or q to quit.
